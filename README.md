### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I little bit about me <br>
:mate: As an engineer, I find great satisfaction in finding solutions to problems and optimizing processes. I'm always on the lookout for ways to automate repetitive tasks, allowing me to focus on adding value to the product. <br>

ðŸŒ± I'm on track with learning more about new frameworks, AI, Data management, and Software Architecture.<br>
âš¡  In my free time, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and spending time with family.<br>
