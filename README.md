I little bit about me <br>
:mate: I was born in Boston, Massachusetts, but I spent the majority of my life in Argentina üá¶üá∑. While there, I studied Industrial Engineering and worked for one of the largest corporations in the world, AB-Inbev üç∫. I returned to the United States with the goal of staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and continuing to grow professionally. As an engineer, I find immense satisfaction in solving problems and optimizing processes. I am constantly searching for ways to automate repetitive tasks, freeing up time to focus on adding value to the final product. <br>
üå± I'm on track with learning more about new frameworks, AI, Data management, and Software Architecture.<br>
‚ö°  In my free time, I enjoy surfing, cooking, and spending time with family.<br>
